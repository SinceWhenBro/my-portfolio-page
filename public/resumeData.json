    "bio": "I am a 20 year old full stack software engineer, natural socialite and passionate musician. I have had an interest in engineering/creating something out of nothing from an early age thanks to my grandpa. He was an automotive engineer for Ford and so we bonded over math and creations made possible because of it. Originally, I thought I'd follow in his tracks and build parts for cars as an automotive engineer but ended up falling in love with software development at 17 ( my last year of highschool). This led me to pursue a degree in Applied Computer Science at NAU, whereafter two years I realized I was not learning adequately to succeed as a software engineer. So, I made one of the smartest--my family may some dumbest--decisions of my life and dropped out of college to find a better way to reach my goal. That's when I found Thinkful which gave me all the tools I needed to create software at a large scale and then some. I'm excited to leave my mark as an innovator in this industry as I learn and create more!  ",
